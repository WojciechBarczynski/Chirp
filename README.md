## Data model
Nodes and relationships can be mapped by Scala's case classes.

### Nodes model
1. User node:
```scala
enum UserStatus: 
  case Active, Blocked, Deleted

case class User(email: String, username: String, password_hash: String, photo: String, bio: String, status: UserStatus)
```

2. Post node:
```scala
enum ResourceKind:
  case Photo, Link

case class Resource(kind: ResourceKind, url: String)

case class Post(content: String, resources: List[Resource])
```

3. Tag node:
```scala
case class Tag(name: String)
```

### Relationships model
1. Follows | User -> User relationship
```scala
enum FollowLevel:
  case AllPosts, PopularPosts, RandomPosts, Blocked

case class Follows(level: FollowLevel)
```

2. ReactedTo | User -> Post relationship
```scala
enum ReactionType:
  case Like, Love, Haha, Wow, Sad, Angry

case class ReactedTo(reaction_type: ReactionType)
```

3. Shared | User -> Post relationship
```scala
case class Shared(datetime: DateTime)
```

4. CreatedBy | Post -> User relationship
```scala
case class CreatedBy(datetime: DateTime)
```

5. Subscribes | User -> Tag relationship
```scala
case class Subscribes(level: FollowLevel)
```

6. CommentedOn | Post -> Post relationship
```scala
case class CommentedOn()
```

7. Tagged | Post -> Tag relationship
```scala
case class Tagged()
```
